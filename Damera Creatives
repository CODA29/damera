A blog website designed for writers to share their ideas. 

Users must create an account to gain access to share their posts.

Once an account is created, the app will redirect users to the blog page. 

The blog page has a button named "contribute." Registered users can click this button to log in and write their blogs. 

Writers are expected to give these three pieces of information : 

                  - Title of their post
                  - Body of their post 
                  - and finally, upload an accompanying picture to their posting.

When finished, click on the 'post' button. Now your new post is visible to other visitors.

Click "log out" when you are done sharing.
